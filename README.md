# ESP32-DualMPU-Shoulder-Rehab-Tracker
Real-time shoulder rehabilitation project using an ESP32 and two MPU6050 sensors (one on the arm, one on the torso). The system measures shoulder flexion (forward movement) and abduction (sideways movement), calculates the angle from the accelerometer data, and tracks the maximum range of motion up to 180°. It also shows progress as a percentage and labels the condition as Severe, Moderate, Improving, or Normal. All values (Angle, Movement type, Max_ROM, and Progress%) are sent over Serial and can be viewed as live graphs in the Arduino Serial Plotter, making it useful for home physiotherapy and research.
